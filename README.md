## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
This problem is a bit tricky because you have to familiarize yourself with Arguments, as you will have to work with two **or more** but on the script you only see two.  You will removea ny number the first argument that is the same as any other arguments.

### REFERENCE LINKS
- [Arguments object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)
- [`Array.filter()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)

## HINTS
### Hint 1
You need to work with `arguments` as if it was a regular array. The best way is to convert it into one.

### Hint 2
You may want to use various methods like: `indexOf()`, `includes()`, or `filter()`.  When in doubt about any function, check those docs!
